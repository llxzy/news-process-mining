# Process mining analysis of news articles  

A school project with the goal of analysing a dataset of news articles with sentiment analysis, then feeding the resulting opinions into pm4py and creating directly-follow graphs which can be analysed.

The dataset used is all-the-news, available [here](https://components.one/datasets/all-the-news-2-news-articles-dataset/) (all credits go to the team at Components).
